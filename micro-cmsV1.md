When making a new page you will notice that the page number does not go up in incremental steps from the other pages suggesting there is hidden pages.

in this example my pages started at 9 ```/page/9```

after i noticed this i went and entered /page/4 where i was greeted by a forbidden page

when you attempt to edit this page you are greeted with **flag 0**
